"""ChunkLoader and the synchronous_loading context object.

There is one global chunk_loader instance to handle async loading for all
Viewer instances. There are two main reasons we do this instead of one
ChunkLoader per Viewer:

1. We size the ChunkCache as a fraction of RAM, so having more than one
   cache would use too much RAM.

2. We might size the thread pool for optimal performance, and having
   multiple pools would result in more workers than we want.

Think of the ChunkLoader as a shared resource like "the filesystem" where
multiple clients can be access it at the same time, but it is the interface
to just one physical resource.

        2) The request result was found in the ChunkCache.

        3) The request.in_memory value is True meaning the arrays are all
           ndarrays and so there no point in using a worker.

        If the load is synchronous then load_chunk() returns the now-satisfied
        request. Otherwise load_chunk() returns None and the Layer's
        chunk_loaded() will be called in the GUI thread sometime in the future
        after the worker as performed the load.
