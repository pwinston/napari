"""ChunkLoader and the synchronous_loading context object.

There is one global chunk_loader instance to handle async loading for all
Viewer instances that are running. There are two main reasons we just have
one ChunkLoader and not one per Viewer:

1. We size the ChunkCache as a fraction of RAM, so having more than one
   would use too much RAM.

2. We (will) size the thread pool for optimal performance, and having
   multiple pools would result in more workers than we want.

Think of the ChunkLoader as a shared resource like "the filesystem" where
multiple clients can be access it at the same time.
