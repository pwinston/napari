"""Performance Monitoring.

To enable perfmon define the env var NAPARI_PERFMON to be non-zero.

The perfmon module lets you instrument your code and visualize its run-time
behavior and timings in Chrome's Tracing GUI.

The best way to add perf_timers is using the perfmon config file. You can
list which methods or functions you want to time, and a perf_timer will be
monkey-patched into each callable on startup. The monkey patching
is done only if perfmon is enabled.

To record a trace define NAPARI_PERFMON and use the menu Debug ->
Performance Trace. Or add a line to your perfmon config file like:

    "trace_file_on_start": "/Path/to/my/trace.json"

Perfmon will start tracing on startup. You must quit napari with the Quit
command for napari to write trace file. See napari.utils.perf._config for
more information.

You can also manually add "perf_timer" context objects and
"add_counter_event()" and "add_instant_event()" functions to your code. All
three of these should be removed before merging the PR into master. While
they have almost zero overhead when perfmon is disabled, it's still better
not to leave them in the code.
