    This was our initial rendering approach for the octree work. This layer
    creates and manages tiles where each tile is a separate ImageVisual.
    The ImageVisuals are all children of our VispyImageLayer node. We also
    draw a grid under our VispyImageLayer node for debugging.

    This works and produces good looking results. However creating separate
    ImageVisuals is fairly slow. We think partly because each one rebuilds
    its shader when it is created. Also as of Fall 2020 we were seeing
    crashes that we think are related to modifying the scene graph. The
    crashes were only under PyQt5, not with PySide2.

    For these reasons we are going to create a new TiledImageVisual that
    internally manages tiles using a texture atlas. The advantage is that
    it's one single visual so there are no scene graph operations when
    adding or removing tiles. Also adding and removing tiles should be
    fast, since the shader will not change. Finally rendering should be
    fast, since in one draw operation we will draw all the tiles that
    make up the image.
